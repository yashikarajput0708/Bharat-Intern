# # Task 1 : Titanic Classification
About the Dataset On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Objective:

Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required). Build a strong classification model to predict whether the passenger survives or not. Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.

# # Task 2 : Stock Prediction
It is build to prediction the stock price of yahoo using LSTM
